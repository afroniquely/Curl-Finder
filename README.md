I mean, seriously! What's not to love?
  

### In a nutshell: this is a game of kitten adventures, how many beats can you follow? Can you catch a kitty tune? As a bonus: improve your memory skills.

### User Story
* As a user I expect to be greated with a starter page where I can press play to begin the game
* As a user I expect that when the game is started, I will see images/colors flash on the screen in a sequence or randomly
* I expect as a user to be able to click on the tiles to replicate the sequence I just saw previously. By clicking each tile, I will reveal the correct image to ensure I am replicating the sequence correctly.
* As a user I expect that if I click the tiles in the right sequence, I will advance to another level
* As a user I expect that when I win the game, I can play again or choose to quit the game.
* I expect that as a user, if I did not win, I can either play the game again, or quit entirely.


### Aim of the Game
Simply match the kitten karaoke rhythm and create some awesome kitty (word) tunes - how good is your memory?
