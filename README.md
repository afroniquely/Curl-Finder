I mean, seriously! What's not to love?
  

### In a nutshell: this is a game of kitten adventures, how many beats can you follow? Can you catch a kitty tune? As a bonus: improve your memory skills.

### User Story
* As a user I expect to be greated with a starter page where I can press play to begin the game
* As a user I expect that when the game is started, I will see images/colors flash on the screen in a sequence or randomly
* I expect as a user to be able to click on the tiles to replicate the sequence I just saw previously. By clicking each tile, I will reveal the correct image to ensure I am replicating the sequence correctly.
* As a user I expect that if I click the tiles in the right sequence, I will advance to another level
* As a user I expect that when I win the game, I can play again or choose to quit the game.
* I expect that as a user, if I did not win, I can either play the game again, or quit entirely.


### Aim of the Game
Simply match the kitten karaoke rhythm and create some awesome kitty (word) tunes - how good is your memory?

### Technologies Used:
* Vanilla Javascript
* Some JQuery
* CSS
* HTML
* Animate.css
* Skeleton Framework

### Approach Taken and Conflict Resolutions
Overall, I tried to create a game that would be a spin off on the Simon Says game of traditional colors, and introduce some fun kitten action. Overall, I tried to implement javascript combined with some jquery functionality. Tried to keep the code DRY as possible.

Roadblocks: I quickly learned a few things broke rather easily and totally were over my skill level at this current point. It was fun to try and tackle, but overall, definitely challenging for me to get a truly fully functioning game. Moral of this story: I will revist and conquer the Kittencapades!

### Things that didn't work
Errors I faced were getting the code to effectively make the flash and random sequence and also just errors on converting a Simon type game into an image based one.
